## Description

The goal of this application is to build a program to allow an e-commerce buisness to track thier inventory using a mySQL database.

## Usage

This application can be used by an e-commerce buisness to list and track thier products.

## What I did

I built a program that uses the ExpressJS and Sequelize to view, add, and edit data about products and product tags for an online buisness.

## What I learned

I learned about how to us Sequelize to access and modify mySQL databases.
